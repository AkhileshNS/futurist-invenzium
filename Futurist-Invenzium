Background Sync: Built UI to show requests and chats, and to send messages

Stuff to do: -
Pre) Make UI Changes (for who knows how long) : FINALLY DONE
1) Connect Firebase to messages (tip: You don't need to import Firebase, just use axios and manipulate the rules)
   This also involves setting up a chronjob to store, get and compare the current date and delete chats accordingly
   FINALLY DONE
2) Connect LocalStorage to requests : FINALLY DONE
3) Connect LocalStorage to Service Worker's Sync Manager to send Data to firebase 
   Looping through LocalStorage to ensure that all requests are sent to Firebase (automatically loading them into messages)
   and then we delete those messages from LocalStorage. : FINALLY DONE using dexie
4) Set it to up incase BackgroundSync isn't supported : FINALLY DONE

#) Before That just review some stuff

1) Come up with a Notifications Icon to use (just google it)
2) Write some stuff about it 
3) Figure Out what else to do from the video
